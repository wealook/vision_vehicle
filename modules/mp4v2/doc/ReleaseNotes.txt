MP4v2 v2.1.3
============

Version 2.1.3 fixes several stability issues, including the following
CVEs:

   - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29584
   - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1451
   - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1450

The 2.1.3 update also fixes a performance issue when operating on files
with unusually large chunks (containing thousands or even millions of
samples instead of the usual few dozen).

MP4v2 v2.1.2
============

Version 2.1.2 fixes build system issues, mainly in the CMake build
system support.  This release also fixes a file seeking issue observed
on Windows when compiled with _WIN32_WINNT < 0x600 and linked against
modern CRT DLLs.  In addition, two minor issues related to data handling
are fixed.

MP4v2 v2.1.1
============

Version 2.1.1 fixes a type mismatch preventing MP4v2 from compiling on
32 bit systems.

MP4v2 v2.1
==========

Version 2.1 updates the existing build systems and adds support for
building with CMake and Xcode.  It also fixes compilation with newer
compilers and integrates smaller improvements and bug fixes from various
MP4v2 forks.

Appendix A Changelog
********************

A.1 Version 2.1
===============

  1. API changes:

        - Added public API functions MP4ReadCallbacks,
          MP4CreateCallbacks[Ex] and MP4ModifyCallbacks[Ex] to allow
          working with custom I/O routines and memory buffers.

        - Added public API function MP4FreeH264SeqPictHeaders to free
          memory allocated by MP4GetTrackH264SeqPictHeaders.

  2. General improvements:

        - I/O system:

             - Switched to ANSI C file I/O on Windows for improved
               performance with large files.

             - Handle extended paths (prefixed with \\?\ or \\?\UNC\) on
               Windows.

        - MP4Modify behavior:

             - Attempt to truncate files if when modify reduces their
               size instead of filling space with a free atom.

             - Attempt to keep moov atom at the start of the file if it
               does not increase in size.

             - Do not leave empty mdat atoms behind after modify.

  3. Tools improvements:

        - Write total length and additonal metadata to .chapters.txt
          files when exporting chapters with mp4chaps.

        - Added options for modifying sort tags (sortartist, sortname
          etc.)  to mp4tags.

  4. Documentation improvements:

        - Converted old API documentation man pages to Doxygen comments
          in the public header files.

  5. Build system improvements:

        - Updated the Autotools build system:

             - Fixed building as a shared library on Windows.

             - Added support for pkg-config.

        - Added support for building with CMake.

        - Upgraded Visual Studio solution and projects for Visual Studio
          2022.

        - Added Xcode project files.

  6. Bug fixes:

        - Fixed issues handling files with sample times exceeding 2^32.

        - Fixed compile errors and warnings with newer versions of
          GCC/Clang.

  7. Vulnerability fixes:

        - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14054
        - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14325

        - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14403
        - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14446
        - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17235
        - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17236

A.2 Version 2.0
===============

  1. Removed deprecated metadata/free-form API and replaced with iTMF
     Generic and Tags API.

  2. Added new public-API: MP4SetLogCallback().

A.3 Version 1.9
===============

  1. Renamed public API top-level header to '<mp4v2/mp4v2.h>' and added
     namespaces for implementation (private) symbols.  Only public API
     symbols are exported for dynamic (shared) or DLL libraries.  All
     other symbols are now private, notwithstanding static-library
     usage.

  2. Added initial AC3 support.

  3. Added native Windows port.  The port targets 'WINVER 0x0500' which
     is Windows 2000 or higher.

  4. Added QuickTime and Nero chapter support.  See 'mp4chaps'
     command-line utility.
     Contributed by Ullrich Poll√§hne <u.pollaehne@gmail.com>.

  5. Enhanced 'mp4art' to support multiple cover-art atoms.

  6. Dropped 'mp4dump' and replaced with 'mp4file' which supports
     general file operations.

  7. Added 'mp4track' with colr-box and pasp-box support.

  8. Fixed corruption of udta.name atom during read-in.

  9. Enhanced 'mp4file --dump' to show hexdump-style canonical hex+ASCII
     data.

  10. Enhanced 'mp4file --dump' to show human-readble value for tag
     typeCode values.

  11. Enhanced 'mp4file --dump' to show human-readble value for
     ISO-639-2/T language codes.

  12. Added new public-API: MP4GetTrackLanguage().

  13. Added new public-API: MP4SetTrackLanguage().

  14. Added support for GCC precompiled-headers on various *nix
     platforms to speed up builds as we are using quite a few C++
     headers.

  15. Enhanced 'mp4track' to facilitate modification of { enabled,
     inmovie, inpreview, altgroup, volume, width, height, language,
     hdlrname, udtaname } properties.

  16. Added new public-API: MP4GetTrackDurationPerChunk().

  17. Added new public-API: MP4SetTrackDurationPerChunk() to override
     default per-track chunk duration.

  18. Added new public-API: MP4WriteSampleDependency().

  19. Replaced (undocumented) public-API: MP4CreateEx() with
     MP4CreateProvider().

  20. Added new public-API for iTMF Generic functionality.
